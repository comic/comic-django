Welcome to grand-challenge.org's documentation!
===============================================

In the era of Deep Learning developing robust machine learning solutions to problems in biomedical imaging
requires access to large amounts of annotated training data,
objective comparison of state of the art machine learning solutions,
and clinical validation using real world data.
`Grand Challenge`_ can assist Researchers, Data Scientists, and Clinicians in collaborating
to develop these solutions by providing:

1. **Archives:** manage medical imaging data.
2. **Reader Studies:** train and have experts make annotations on medical imaging data.
3. **Challenges:** gather and objectively assess machine learning solutions.
4. **Algorithms:** deploy machine learning solutions for clinical validation.
5. **Products:** find commercialised machine learning solutions in medical imaging.

Here, you find the documentation for the Django application that powers `Grand Challenge`_.
You are able to use the instance there,
add additional features by making a PR to our `GitHub repository`_,
or spin up your own instance.
